# My Study Notes Repository

[Jump To Notes Index](index.md)

## Why a Repository for Study Notes?
When taking code courses online, I learned a lot of new languages quickly. Hands-on experience was brief and some info was difficult to retain.

Once all my courses were complete, I decided to review what I learned using better study methods.
The idea to make a repository came from a [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/11n6n7z/using_github_to_write_my_notes_has_helped_me/) by u/Cylvher.

## Goals
* Practice using dev tools while I learn to code.
* Develop a method of retaining info that fits my learning style.
* Become a more efficient learner over time.

## My Method

1. To refresh my memory, I take physical notes using the [Cornell Method](cornell-notes.md) while watching overview videos on any topic I'm reviewing.
2. I copy these physical notes into a .md file using [Markdown](markdown.md) formatting. I use PHP Storm to create and manage these files.
3. I upload the .md files to a Github repository

## Why Physical Notes?
Cornell Notes prompt my brain to consider new material in several different ways, whereas typing my notes is too passive for me to do any deep thinking.

## Why Markdown?
Markdown is an easy way to write plaintext and convert it to valid html. Thus, content is easily recorded and easily reformatted later for publishing.

## Why PHPStorm?
* PHPStorm is the preferred tool amongst the devs I'm working with right now.
* PHPStorm has some smart tracking features that will keep my project organized (like managing relative links if I change the project's file structure).
